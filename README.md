# SAIDI, SAIFI & MAIFI Power Reliability Analysis

This repository analyzes power distribution reliability using standard indices—**SAIDI**, **SAIFI**, and **MAIFI**—to identify loss-prone areas, evaluate feeder performance, and assess the reliability impact of **solar renewable integration**.

The project uses **SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI** to process outage data, benchmark performance against Indian utility standards (e.g., Torrent Power–style metrics), and generate actionable improvement recommendations.

---

## Project Objectives

- Calculate SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI from outage data  
- Identify high-loss feeders, regions, and sectors  
- Compare urban vs rural and solar-integrated networks  
- Visualize reliability trends and heatmaps  
- Recommend targeted actions to reduce outage frequency and duration  

---

## Reliability Indices

- **SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index)**  
  Average number of interruptions per customer


- **MAIFI (Momentary Average Interruption Frequency Index)**  
Momentary interruptions (< 5 minutes), critical for solar-heavy feeders  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL)**  
- Outage aggregation  
- Index computation  
- Sector and feeder-wise loss analysis  

- **Excel**  
- Data cleaning  
- Pivot tables  
- Preliminary reliability summaries  

- **Python**  
- Pandas for data processing  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for trend analysis  
- Statistical loss modeling  

- **Power BI**  
- Interactive dashboards  
- SAIDI/SAIFI heatmaps  
- Solar-specific MAIFI visualization

## Key Features

- Automated calculation of SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI  
- Sector-level loss analysis (urban, rural, solar-integrated feeders)  
- Identification of high-risk circuits (e.g., feeders with SAIFI > 0.1)  
- Solar reliability assessment focusing on momentary interruptions  
- Improvement recommendations including:
- Feeder automation and reclosers  
- Vegetation management  
- Faster fault isolation and restoration  

Targeted improvements can reduce **SAIDI by 20–30%** on worst-performing feeders.
