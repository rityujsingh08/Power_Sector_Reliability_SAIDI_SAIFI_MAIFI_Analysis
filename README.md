# ⚡ Power Reliability Analysis using SAIDI, SAIFI & MAIFI

This repository presents an end-to-end **power distribution reliability analysis** using standard utility indices—**SAIDI**, **SAIFI**, and **MAIFI**—to identify loss-prone areas, assess feeder performance, and evaluate the reliability impact of **solar renewable integration**.

The project uses **SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI** to process outage data, visualize reliability trends, and recommend actionable improvements inspired by **real-world Indian utility benchmarks** (e.g., Torrent Power).

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📉 Measure power reliability using SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI  
- 🗺️ Identify **high-loss feeders, regions, and sectors**  
- 🏙️ Compare **urban vs rural** distribution performance  
- ☀️ Analyze reliability impact of **solar-integrated networks**  
- 🛠️ Recommend targeted actions to reduce outages and restoration time

## 📊 Reliability Indices Explained

- **SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index)**  
  Average number of interruptions per customer

- **SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index)**  
Average outage duration per customer  

- **MAIFI (Momentary Average Interruption Frequency Index)**  
Momentary interruptions (< 5 minutes), critical for solar-heavy feeders

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (MySQL)**  
- Outage aggregation  
- Index computation  
- Sector and feeder-wise loss analysis  

- **Excel**  
- Data cleaning  
- Pivot tables  
- Preliminary reliability summaries  

- **Python**  
- Pandas for data processing  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for trend analysis  
- Statistical loss modeling  

- **Power BI**  
- Interactive dashboards  
- SAIDI/SAIFI heatmaps  
- Solar-specific MAIFI visualization

## Key Features

- Automated calculation of SAIDI, SAIFI, and MAIFI  
- Sector-level loss analysis (urban, rural, solar-integrated feeders)  
- Identification of high-risk circuits (e.g., feeders with SAIFI > 0.1)  
- Solar reliability assessment focusing on momentary interruptions  
- Improvement recommendations including:
- Feeder automation and reclosers  
- Vegetation management  
- Faster fault isolation and restoration  

Targeted improvements can reduce **SAIDI by 20–30%** on worst-performing feeders.
